      Koogeesakee is a digital game experience, based on Jujutsu Kaisen manga series by Gege Akutami.
      In this game you take a role of Nobara Kugisaki (釘くぎ崎さき野の薔ば薇ら), who is  the tritagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
      She is a first-year student and grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High studying under Satoru Gojo alongside Yuji and Megumi.
      With an ability to spawn nails and a trusty hammer by her side, you can overcome various challenges that are posed by other players.
      Thanks to lobby and chat system, players can make their own rules, which makes the game a little bit more replayable.
      And with a brand new level editor coming soon, the possibilites are endless. What are you waiting for? DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!
